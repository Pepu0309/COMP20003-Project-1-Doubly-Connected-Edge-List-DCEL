# COMP20003-Project-1-Voronoi-Diagram-

Coding the DCEL data structure was a nightmare. Probably one of the hardest and most time-consuming projects I worked on ever. But it was a very rewarding learning experience as I got to utilise a lot of Valgrind and GDB which helped me a lot in my 3rd year COMP30023 Projects.
